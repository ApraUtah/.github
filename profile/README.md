Why does this exist? 

Some things - especially code snippets and files - work really well when hosted on Github. The idea is that Apra Utah's presence on GitHub is just another resource that may be helpful as you explore technical solutions to every-day prospect development obstacles, and also a technical playground for building new tools!
In a world where vendors are constantly increasing prices, creating open-source tools that even the most humble non-profit volunteer prospect researcher at a shoestring-budget non-profit can benefit from!

Hopefully, this expands beyond our little regional professional association. It would be amazing to have other Apra chapters collaborating on Github!

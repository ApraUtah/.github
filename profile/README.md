# Why does this exist?

GitHub is a great platform for sharing code snippets, files, and collaborative projects. Apra Utah's presence here is meant to be a helpful resource for tackling common prospect development challenges, while also serving as a technical playground for building and experimenting with new tools.

In an environment where vendor costs continue to rise, open-source solutions can empower even the most budget-conscious nonprofit professionals and volunteer researchers.

We hope this effort grows beyond our regional chapterâ€”imagine the potential of Apra chapters collaborating across GitHub!
